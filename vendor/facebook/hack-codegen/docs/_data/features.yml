- title: Signed Files
  text: |
        Generated files are signed to prevent or detect manual modifications of
        generated code; these files can then be regenerated with new content in
        the future, or signatures can be disabled to generate 'skeleton' code,
        if any future changes will be manual.

- title: Partially Generated Files
  text: |
        Generated code can be marked as containing manually-modifiable
        sections; you can use hack-codegen to rewrite the rest of the file in
        the future, and all manual sections will be left unmodified.
  
- title: Readable Output
  text: |
        All built-in features handle whitespace correctly, and it's easy to
        integrate this into custom code.

- title: Extensible and Type-Safe Value Rendering
  text: |
        Hack Codegen can render any value as raw literal code or using
        `var_export()`; additionally, there's built-in support for
        pretty-printed collections, shapes, and `classname<T>`.
        
        These can be nested arbitrarily for shapes and collections, and can
        be extended by providing a lambda, or creating a class implementing the
        key or value renderer interfaces.
